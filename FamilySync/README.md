# FamilySync

A custom calendar application that I created during my time at BYU-Idaho. It took a total of around 116 hours to complete the project. To run it, simply find the app-release.apk located in the app folder and install on your favorite device or emulator. Alternatively, you can download the Android Studio files and open the project in Android Studio.
Contains many features such as:
* FireBase Authentication
  * Create your own account using FireBase Auth
* FireBase Database Live Syncing
  * Sync instantly with everyone in your family
* Save Event Information to Re-Use
  * For events that happen irregularly
* Simple Look
  * Avoid all the clutter
